# pokemon-memory-game

In this project, the PokeAPI has been used to create a memory game based on the pokemons of the first six generations. The PokeAPI is a RESTful API that provides a large amount of information about Pokemon. The game has been developed entirely in vanilla JavaScript, which means that no additional frameworks or libraries have been used.
