# pokemon-memory-game

This is a project based on the YouTube tutorial [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2O3QxpcdSk), which explores the process of consuming an API to get and display data. I decided to implement this project as part of my learning to better understand the API consumption process.
